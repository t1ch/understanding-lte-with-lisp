# Understanding 3GPP LTE With Common Lisp
This is a place where I learn the ins and outs of the 3GPP LTE technical specification. The goal is to have an understanding of the subject such that I can implement an eNodeB using the bladeRF micro 2. I would like to implement the PHY layer with gateware on the FPGA. The MAC layer going upwards will be in Common Lisp. Key findings and discriptions of algorithms will be documented in the **[wiki](https://github.com/t1ch/understanding-lte-with-lisp/wiki)**

I am aware that there are various open source projects implementing 3GPP LTE standard. Todate I know of: 
1. [OpenLTE](https://sourceforge.net/projects/openlte/)
2. [srsRAN](https://github.com/srsran/srsRAN)
